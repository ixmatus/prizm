0.3.1.1
=======

- Adding a little bit of documentation and better documentation in the
  Description field.

0.3.1.0
=======

- Cleaned up the color functions a bit and added a few more.

0.3.0.0
=======

- Separated the CIE representations out into their own modules so that
  I could implement their own convenience functions to go to/from all
  of the other different representations without arduous function
  chaining. Particularly for HEX/RGB -> LCH (involves around 5
  function calls!).
- Removed the Angle package.
- Fixed the tests to accomodate the API changes.

0.2.1.0
=======

- Adding conversion functions for CIE L*ab and CIE L*Ch.
- Blending is now done in the CIE L*Ch color space.
- Tests for L*ab to L*Ch now pass.

0.2.0.0
=======

- Adding in Weighted Blending, Darkening, Lightening, Shading, and
  Tinting functions.

0.1.0.4
=======

- Adding toHex and fromHex functions.

0.1.0.3
=======

- Re-defined the CIE types so they are their own separate types
  instead of branch types.
- Implemented instances of Functor and Applicative for all color
  types.

0.1.0.2
=======

- CIE XYZ to CIE L*a*b* formula implemented.
- CIE L*a*b* to CIE XYZ formula implemented.
- Implemented better fractional values in the formulas gleaned from
  this website: [CIE Conversion Mathematics](http://rip94550.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/color-cielab-and-tristimulus-xyz/).
- Comprehensive QuickCheck tests finished and pass with a lossless
  conversion at 11 decimal places.

0.1.0.1
=======

- SRGB to CIE XYZ formula implemented.
- CIE XYZ to SRGB formula implemented.
- Comprehensive QuickCheck tests finished and pass (conversion is lossless).

0.1.0.0
=======

- Package set up, types figured out.
- Research on different color representations, illuminants,
  chromaticity, etc...
